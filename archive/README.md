# Archive

This directory contains files that are no longer actively used in the project but are kept for historical reference.

## Structure

### old-test-docs/
Test documentation and snapshots from early development (December 4-5, 2025):
- `FAILING-TESTS.md` - Snapshot of failing tests
- `TESTING.md` - Early testing documentation
- `TESTING-WORKFLOW.md` - Original test workflow
- `TEST-RESULTS.md` - Test results snapshot
- `TEST-RESULTS-FINAL.md` - Final test results from early development
- `stakeholder-enhancements-old-copy.ts` - Old duplicate of src/data/stakeholder-enhancements.ts

These are superseded by active test development and the live test suite.

### session-guides/

- `RESUME-SESSION.md` - Guide for resuming schema redesign session (completed)
- `MANUAL-TEST-GUIDE.md` - Manual testing guide for F044 stakeholder enhancements
- `test-enhancements.js` - Standalone test script for stakeholder enhancements

These were used for specific development sessions that are now complete.

### source-materials/
Original source files used during initial setup (December 8, 2025):
- `source-photos/` - Original stakeholder icon photos before conversion
- `extract-icons.py` - Python script used to extract and process icons

These were used once during initial setup and are no longer needed for development.

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

These files provide historical context and may be useful for:
- Understanding project evolution
- Reference for similar future work
- Audit trail for development decisions
