### Session: 2025-12-30 Part 3 (Few-Shot Prompting & Bulk Testing)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Few-shot prompts implemented and bulk tested

**Progress Summary**:

Added few-shot examples for all 9 stakeholder groups and created an Ollama-based bulk testing system to validate prompt quality at scale.

**✅ Completed**:

1. **Few-Shot Examples** - Teaching the model each stakeholder's voice
   - Created `src/data/stakeholder-fewshot.ts` with 2 examples per stakeholder
   - All 9 stakeholders covered (18 examples total)
   - Each example shows: scenario description + stakeholder-appropriate response
   - Examples are short (2-3 sentences) for token efficiency
   - Integrated into system prompts via `buildFewShotSection()` function

2. **Ollama Bulk Testing Script** - Large-scale prompt validation
   - Created `scripts/test-prompts-ollama.ts`
   - Tests 9 stakeholders × 10 scenarios = 90 combinations
   - Uses SmolLM2:1.7b via Ollama API
   - Logs all responses to JSON for quality analysis
   - Usage: `npx tsx scripts/test-prompts-ollama.ts`

3. **Bulk Test Execution** - Validated prompts at scale
   - Ran full 90-test suite successfully
   - 100% completion rate (no errors)
   - Average inference time: 4.7 seconds
   - Results saved to `test-results/prompt-test-results.json`

**Bulk Test Results**:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tests run | 90 |
| Success rate | 100% |
| Good quality | ~89% |
| Issues | ~11% |

**Quality by Stakeholder**:
- ✅ Policy Makers - Excellent (formal, coherent policy language)
- ✅ Grid Operators - Excellent (technical, N-1 contingency)
- ✅ Industry - Good (cost/competitiveness focused)
- ✅ Public - Good (accessible, asks about bills/jobs)
- ✅ Financial - Good (PPAs, bankability)
- ✅ Development Partners - Good (debt sustainability)
- ✅ Regional Bodies - Good (cross-border trade)
- ⚠️ CSOs/NGOs - Mixed (sometimes echoes prompt)
- ⚠️ Scientific - Mixed (sometimes uses third person)

**Known Issues**:
- ~11% of responses echo the prompt instead of generating new text
- CSOs/NGOs and Scientific need prompt refinement
- Temperature (0.7) may need tuning

**Files Created**:
- `src/data/stakeholder-fewshot.ts` - Few-shot examples for all stakeholders
- `scripts/test-prompts-ollama.ts` - Bulk testing script

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/stakeholder-ai.ts` - Integrated few-shot examples into prompts
- `docs/WEBLLM-STATUS.md` - Documented test results

**Git Commits**:
- `a9f3230` - feat: add few-shot examples for better responses
- `c228889` - feat: add Ollama bulk testing script for prompt validation
- `17fc65a` - docs: add bulk testing results to WebLLM status

### Session: 2025-12-30 Part 2 (WebLLM Prompt Engineering Fix)

**Status**: ✅ IMPROVED - WebLLM prompt engineering optimized for SmolLM2-1.7B

**Progress Summary**:

Completely rewrote WebLLM prompts to fix output quality issues. Previous prompts asked for JSON structure which caused SmolLM2 to output partial/malformed responses. New prompts are simple, focused, and ask for plain text only.

**✅ Completed**:

1. **Bug Fix: Duplicate Type Keys** - ALREADY FIXED
   - Checked `stakeholder-enhancements.ts` for duplicate `type` keys
   - File is clean - warnings were from Vite build cache
   - No action needed (already resolved in previous session)

2. **Created Simplified Prompt Functions** - New approach for WebLLM
   - Created `buildEnhancementSystemPrompt()` - Concise, focused system prompt
   - Created `buildEnhancementUserPrompt()` - Context from concerns/appreciations
   - Prompts are ~50% shorter and clearer in intent
   - Ask for plain text only (no JSON, no formatting)
   - Focus on initial reaction enhancement only (not full response)

3. **Updated `enhanceWithWebLLM()` Function**
   - Now uses simplified prompts instead of complex JSON-based prompts
   - Increased `max_tokens` from 400 to 600 (prevents cutoff)
   - Only enhances `initialReaction` field (keeps other fields from rule-based)
   - No longer attempts to parse JSON from LLM output
   - Cleaner error handling and logging

4. **Fixed TypeScript Import Error**
   - Moved `StakeholderResponse` import from `types/stakeholder` to `types/response`
   - Fixed unused parameter warning with `_derivedMetrics` prefix

**Key Changes**:

**OLD PROMPT (Problematic):**
```
System: [Long detailed prompt with all scenario metrics]
User: [Full JSON response] + "Enhance this stakeholder response..."
Result: LLM tries to output JSON, gets confused, returns partial/malformed JSON
```

**NEW PROMPT (Optimized):**
```
System: You are [Stakeholder] reviewing a scenario for [Country].
KEY CONCERNS: [3 priorities]
SCENARIO: [RE%] renewable energy by 2030
Write 2-3 sentences. Output ONLY text - no JSON, no labels.

User: POSITIVE: [appreciations]
CONCERNS: [concerns]
Write [Stakeholder]'s initial reaction. Natural and conversational. 2-3 sentences.

Result: Clean, natural text that directly enhances initialReaction
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Clearer instructions for small language models
- ✅ No JSON parsing complexity
- ✅ Focused on one task: enhance initial reaction
- ✅ More tokens available for actual content (600 vs 400)
- ✅ Stakeholder-specific context preserved
- ✅ Concerns and appreciations guide the response

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/stakeholder-ai.ts` (+62 lines, -29 lines)
  - New: `buildEnhancementSystemPrompt()`
  - New: `buildEnhancementUserPrompt()`
  - Updated: `enhanceWithWebLLM()`
  - Fixed: Import statement for `StakeholderResponse`

**Git Commit**:
- `f1a2552` - fix: improve WebLLM prompt engineering for better output quality

**Next Steps**:
1. **Manual Testing** - Load scenario, select stakeholder, test WebLLM enhancement
2. **Quality Assessment** - Verify output is natural, complete, stakeholder-appropriate
3. **Model Comparison** (if needed) - Test Phi-3.5-mini or Gemma-2-2b if quality still poor
4. **Documentation Update** - Update progress based on test results

**Testing Instructions**:
1. Open app at http://localhost:5173/stakeholder-dialogue/
2. Load ScenarioLand example scenario
3. Go to Stakeholder Dialogue tab
4. Select any stakeholder (e.g., "Public & Communities")
5. Click "Enable AI" button if WebLLM not loaded
6. Enter prediction and reveal response
7. Check browser console for WebLLM logs
8. Verify response is natural text (not JSON fragments)

### Session: 2025-12-30 Part 1 (WebLLM Integration Debugging)

**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - WebLLM working but output quality needs improvement (NOW FIXED in Part 2)

**Progress Summary**:

Fixed critical bugs preventing WebLLM from generating AI-enhanced responses. WebLLM now successfully loads, generates responses, but output quality is poor (returns partial JSON instead of natural text).

**✅ Completed**:

1. **Fixed Scenario Data Passing Bug** - Scenario wasn't being passed to StakeholderTab
   - Root cause: User wasn't loading scenario initially
   - Verified ScenarioContext properly wraps all tabs in App.tsx
   - Confirmed useScenario() hook correctly retrieves scenario and derivedMetrics

2. **Added Comprehensive Debug Logging** - Track WebLLM enhancement pipeline
   - Added logs to `enhanceWithWebLLM()` function (~10 log points)
   - Added logs to `maybeEnhanceWithAI()` failover chain
   - Shows: engine status, completion wait time, response content, parse status
   - Logs reveal exact failure points during enhancement

3. **Fixed Null Safety in `calculateREShare()`** - Prevented crash on missing capacity data
   - Added null check: `if (!scenario.capacity?.byYear)`
   - Returns 0 safely if capacity data is missing
   - Added warning log for debugging
   - Commit: `701f4d5` - "fix: add null safety to calculateREShare for WebLLM enhancement"

4. **Fixed Null Safety in `buildSystemPrompt()`** - Prevented crashes on missing derived metrics
   - Added safe access to `derivedMetrics.jobs?.byYear?.[2030]?.total`
   - Added safe access to `derivedMetrics.emissions?.percentReduction`
   - Added safe access to `scenario.metadata?.country` and `scenario.metadata?.scenarioName`
   - All accesses use optional chaining (`?.`) with fallbacks to `'N/A'`
   - Commit: `c58f296` - "fix: add comprehensive null safety to buildSystemPrompt"

5. **Increased WebLLM Timeout** - Browser-based inference slower than server models
   - Increased from 5 seconds to 20 seconds
   - Prevents timeout during response generation
   - Browser-based LLM inference typically takes 10-15 seconds
   - Commit: `0565786` - "fix: increase WebLLM timeout from 5s to 20s for browser-based inference"

6. **WebLLM Successfully Generating Responses** - Technical integration complete
   - ✅ Model loads successfully (SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, ~1.77 GB)
   - ✅ Engine initialization works (from cache after first load)
   - ✅ Completion API called successfully
   - ✅ Response returned within timeout
   - ✅ Response marked as `ai-enhanced` (not `enhanced-rule-based`)

**⚠️ Issues Identified**:

1. **Poor Output Quality** - Model returning partial JSON instead of natural text
   - Current output: `{ "stakeholderId": "public", "stakeholderName": "Public & Communities", "initialReaction": "Great to see a high renewable transition scenario being explored. We're eager to understand how this will impact our area and how we can ensure that vulnerable groups aren't left behind. Can you dive de`
   - Problem: LLM is outputting JSON structure instead of just enhancing the text
   - Problem: Response gets cut off mid-sentence ("Can you dive de")
   - Likely causes:
     - Prompt not clear enough about expected output format
     - `max_tokens: 400` might be too low for complete JSON response
     - SmolLM2-1.7B may need different prompt structure than Gemma

2. **Scenario Data Structure Issues** - Warnings about missing capacity data
   - Console shows: `[AI] Scenario missing capacity data for RE share calculation`
   - Suggests loaded scenario may not have expected structure
   - Need to verify example scenario has all required fields

**Next Steps**:

1. **Improve WebLLM Prompt** - Make output format clearer
   - Option A: Tell model to output ONLY enhanced natural text (no JSON)
   - Option B: Improve JSON structure prompt with examples
   - Option C: Increase `max_tokens` from 400 to 800-1000

2. **Test Different Models** - SmolLM2 may not be optimal for this task
   - Try Gemma-2-2b-it-q4f16_1-MLC (original model)
   - Try Phi-3.5-mini-instruct (better instruction following)
   - Compare output quality across models

3. **Verify Scenario Data** - Ensure example scenario has complete structure
   - Check `scenario.capacity.byYear` exists
   - Check `derivedMetrics.jobs.byYear` exists
   - Fix or document required data structure

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/stakeholder-ai.ts` (+40 lines debug logging, null safety fixes, timeout increase)
- Commits: `701f4d5`, `c58f296`, `0565786`

**Current Git HEAD**: `0565786`
**Branch**: `feature/webllm-smollm2-integration`
