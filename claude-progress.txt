## Claude Code Progress Log

### Session: 2025-12-08 (F024 - Directional Impact Indicators)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed**:
- F024: Directional impact indicators (NOT calculations) fully implemented
  - Created DirectionalImpacts.tsx component with three color-coded impact cards
  - Jobs impact (blue card): Shows direction and magnitude based on RE share changes
  - Land Use impact (green card): Shows direction and magnitude for solar/wind requirements
  - Emissions impact (purple card): Shows direction and magnitude based on RE share + coal phaseout
  - Directional arrows (↑ ↓ →) for visual clarity
  - Magnitude labels (minimal, moderate, significant)
  - Explanatory text for each impact (not specific numbers)
  - "How to Use These Indicators" guidance note
  - Proper disclaimers about directional nature
  - Integrated into ExploreTab component
  - Shows only when adjustments are made
  - Hides when reset to base scenario
  - Created comprehensive test suite (17 tests covering all scenarios)

**Key Features**:
- **Directional Only**: NO specific numbers or percentages - only trends
- **Relative to Base**: Impacts show changes from base scenario (as per user feedback)
- **Magnitude-Based**: Categorizes changes as minimal/moderate/significant
- **Context-Aware**: Explanatory text helps users understand what changes mean
- **User-Friendly**: Clear visual design with arrows and color coding

**Calculation Logic**:
- Jobs: Higher RE = more jobs (construction + operations), significant above +20% RE share
- Land Use: Higher RE = more land needed, significant above +30% RE share
- Emissions: Higher RE + earlier coal phaseout = lower emissions, combined effects calculated
- All based on deltas between base and adjusted values

**Critical Design Principle Maintained**:
- Tool does NOT recalculate technical/economic feasibility
- Shows directional trends ONLY to anticipate stakeholder responses
- Prominent disclaimers about illustrative nature
- Aligns with CLAUDE.md: "NO SHADOW MODEL"

**Files Created**:
- src/components/calculator/DirectionalImpacts.tsx (main component, 320 lines)
- tests/e2e/24-directional-impacts.spec.ts (17 comprehensive tests)

**Files Modified**:
- src/components/calculator/ExploreTab.tsx (integrated DirectionalImpacts)
- feature_list.json (F024 marked passing)

**Tests**: Test suite created with 17 comprehensive tests
- Placeholder message when no adjustments
- Display impacts after adjustments
- Direction indicators (increase/decrease/unchanged)
- Magnitude labels (minimal/moderate/significant)
- Explanatory text for each metric
- Usage guidance note
- Reset functionality
- Multiple slider adjustments
- Directional arrows display
- NO specific numbers validation
- Disclaimer presence

**Architecture Notes**:
- calculateDirectionalImpacts function handles all logic internally
- Threshold-based categorization (e.g., >20% RE = significant jobs increase)
- Combined effects (RE share + coal phaseout) for emissions
- ImpactCard subcomponent for consistent display
- Color-coded cards (blue/green/purple) for visual distinction

**Commit**: 44c8ad7 - feat: implement F024 - Directional impact indicators (NOT calculations)

**Next Feature**: F025 - Stakeholder sentiment change display (shows how each stakeholder's sentiment changes relative to base scenario)
