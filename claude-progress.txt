## Claude Code Progress Log

### Session: 2025-12-05 (F012 - Quick Entry Form)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed**:
- Removed all EAPP-specific references from documentation (CLAUDE.md, feature_list.json)
- Made tool generic for global application (not region-specific)
- Created QuickEntryForm.tsx with 15 essential fields:
  - Country dropdown with 100+ countries (global list)
  - Scenario name
  - Capacity fields for 2030 and 2040 (renewable, fossil, battery)
  - Investment totals for 2030 and 2050
  - Emissions for 2025, 2030, 2050
  - Peak demand for 2030 and 2040
- Implemented form validation:
  - Required field validation (country, scenario name)
  - Non-negative numeric validation
  - Clear errors when user starts typing
- Conversion logic from QuickScenarioInput to full ScenarioInput:
  - Distributes renewable capacity into solar, wind, hydro
  - Distributes fossil capacity into coal, gas, diesel
  - Generates all milestone years (2025, 2030, 2040, 2050)
  - Creates full generation, investment, emissions, demand data
- Integrated form into InputTab (replaces placeholder)
- Created comprehensive test suite (10 tests, all passing)
- Target: completable in under 3 minutes ✓
