### Highlight
WEC's thorough and diverse workshops leverage strong facilitation to co-create socio-political narratives for global scenarios, combined with interactive exercises that allow stakeholders to examine their own roles within the changes exemplified.

### Lessons Learnt
1. Ensuring diverse participation from across sectors (academia, government, industry, start-ups) and regions is critical for capturing global energy priorities
2. Employing diverse tools (policy simulators, frameworks, interactive workshops) helps cater to varying stakeholder needs
3. Narrative-based scenarios considering socio-political realities alongside technical and economic factors provide actionable insights
