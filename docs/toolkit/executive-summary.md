# Executive Summary

The global energy transition requires unprecedented co-ordination across all sectors of society. As countries accelerate their shift toward renewable energy systems, the complexity and scale of the transformation demands inclusive planning processes that engage diverse stakeholders and build broad consensus for ambitious climate and energy goals.

This toolkit, developed through IRENA's Long-Term Energy Scenarios (LTES) Network, provides government energy planners with practical guidance for implementing effective participatory processes in national energy scenario development.

## The Expanding Stakeholder Landscape

The energy transition has fundamentally expanded the landscape of stakeholders involved in energy systems. Beyond traditional utilities and fossil fuel companies, energy planning now encompasses:
- Prosumers
- Energy co-operatives
- Local communities
- Indigenous groups
- Civil society organisations
- Businesses across all economic sectors

Despite widespread recognition of the importance of participatory processes, comprehensive guidance has been lacking on approaches and best practices for national-level energy planning. This toolkit addresses this gap by synthesising experiences from government planning institutions worldwide.

## Key Benefits of Participatory Energy Planning

Evidence from IRENA's LTES Network shows that effective stakeholder engagement can lead to multiple benefits:

### 1. Building Consensus and Trust
Participatory processes foster stakeholder ownership and social acceptance by involving diverse voices in scenario development. Countries have shown how inclusive engagement builds legitimacy for energy plans while identifying potential risks and conflicts early.

### 2. Gathering Diverse Inputs
Stakeholder participation helps identify planning blind spots and improve the extent to which scenarios reflect real-world conditions. Engagement with at-risk communities, for instance, brings essential perspectives on energy access that might otherwise be overlooked.

### 3. Enhancing Implementation
Scenarios developed through participatory processes are more likely to be accepted by policy makers and society. Early involvement of key stakeholders ensures energy plans align with institutional capacities and political realities.

### 4. Building Energy Literacy
Engagement activities enhance understanding of energy systems across stakeholder groups, creating more informed participants who can contribute meaningfully to energy transition discussions and decisions.

## Strategic Framework

The toolkit presents a comprehensive framework organised around three core categories of participatory approaches:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Knowledge Gathering** | Workshops, surveys, public consultations and expert interviews designed to collect diverse perspectives from stakeholders across sectors |
| **Co-creation** | Steering committees, working groups and network structures that enable stakeholders to actively participate in shaping scenarios and building consensus |
| **Knowledge Dissemination** | Presentations, reports, visualisation tools and interactive platforms that communicate complex energy concepts to various audiences |

## Stakeholder Engagement Strategies

The toolkit identifies seven key stakeholder groups often considered important for comprehensive energy planning:

1. Policy makers and regulators
2. Grid operators
3. Industry representatives
4. The general public and local communities
5. Civil society organisations
6. Scientific institutions
7. Financial institutions

Successful engagement requires tailored approaches that recognise different stakeholders' capacities, interests and constraints.

## Global Evidence and Lessons

Thirteen detailed case studies from a range of countries and international organisations illustrate diverse approaches to participatory energy planning, ranging from Chile's comprehensive consultation framework to Canada's Energy Modelling Hub.

### Key Lessons Include:
- Importance of clear governance structures
- Sustained funding commitments
- Skilled facilitation
- Transparent communication about how stakeholder inputs influence final outcomes

## The Path Forward

This toolkit serves as both a reference guide for immediate application and a foundation for continued innovation in participatory energy planning. By adapting these proven approaches to their specific contexts, government energy planners can foster more inclusive, transparent and effective processes that accelerate the clean energy transition while ensuring no one is left behind.

The experiences documented demonstrate that **meaningful stakeholder engagement is essential for planning and achieving ambitious energy and climate goals**.
