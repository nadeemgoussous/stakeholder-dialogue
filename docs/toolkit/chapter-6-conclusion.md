# Chapter 6: Conclusion

Participatory methods continue to be utilised more widely in government planning activities, especially with the essential and timely focus on a clean and just energy transition.

Engaging in stakeholder consultation can help achieve these goals by:
- Building inclusive and empowering processes
- Increasing public acceptance and buy-in for the ongoing transition

## Using This Toolkit

This toolkit, designed for scenario planners in government planning institutions, but relevant also for other actors involved in scenario building and energy system modelling, provides a versatile resource for planners to enhance their energy scenario development processes.

### Identifying Relevant Case Studies

Planners can examine the detailed examples provided, selecting those that align with their specific objectives and contexts:

- **Improving public engagement**: Draw inspiration from Brazil's use of virtual debates and online workshops
- **Concise policy communication**: Benefit from Cyprus's approach to creating clear and effective policy briefs

### Evaluating Feasibility

By reviewing the activities and tools showcased in the case studies, planners can evaluate the feasibility of different participatory methods within the constraints of their resources and institutional capabilities.

**Example**: A country with limited financial resources might prioritise online consultations over more resource-intensive in-person workshops, ensuring practical and efficient implementation.

### Identifying Best Practices

By analysing successful examples, planners can:
- Identify best practices for working with specific stakeholder groups
- Select tools that align with their desired outcomes

### Anticipating Challenges

The toolkit highlights lessons from other countries, enabling planners to anticipate and avoid potential challenges.

### Practical Application

By leveraging the toolkit as a guide and reference, national energy planners can integrate effective participatory processes into their energy planning. Drawing on real-world examples and tailoring these insights to their unique circumstances, planners can foster a more **inclusive, transparent and successful** energy planning process.

## Challenges and Future Work

This toolkit highlights the importance of participatory processes in national energy planning, and some existing and novel cases and tools that have been used by governmental and non-governmental institutions to engage stakeholders.

However, overarching challenges and gaps remain that warrant further research and implementation.

### Current Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Feedback mechanisms** | Experts highlighted the dearth of existing mechanisms to inform stakeholders about how their participation influenced planning results and project outcomes. A more reciprocal communication style could be key to ensuring stakeholders maintain their interest. |
| **"Box-ticking" exercises** | In some instances, stakeholder engagement could be considered a "box-ticking" exercise, nullifying its alleged purposes and decreasing confidence among stakeholders. |
| **Inherent biases** | Concerns exist regarding the project team's inherent biases affecting inputs and how they are represented within modelling exercises. |
| **Scaling innovative methodologies** | Challenges remain in translating innovative methodologies of public participation within comprehensive national-level planning, where constraints such as resources and/or political will may exist. |
| **Evaluating outcomes** | Challenges exist in evaluating participatory process outcomes, measuring key performance indicators (KPIs), and evaluating benefits of implementing a participatory process versus not conducting one. |

### Future Opportunities

New opportunities and challenges may arise, including:

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Use of AI, machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to:
  - Improve and analyse stakeholder priorities and inputs
  - Design participatory activities
  - Address stakeholder comments in the scenario development process and results

### Questions for Project Design

Such challenges can be worth examining at the project design level, in relation to the project's purported objectives:
- Can the challenges be overcome simply by improving the participatory strategy and using the correct tools?
- Or are novel methods and frameworks needed?

### Looking Ahead

As further importance and funding are placed on using participatory methods in scenario design and policy making, we may continue to see these questions being addressed, with innovative solutions and case studies that will continue to be explored within the work of the LTES Network.
