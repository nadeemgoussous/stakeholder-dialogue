# Chapter 4: Engagement Tools and Activities

This chapter outlines the different tools and activities that government planners can utilise when engaging stakeholders in energy planning processes, with many of them used in the case studies in [Chapter 5](./chapter-5-case-studies.md).

These tools fulfil different purposes in the planning process: some help to collect stakeholder perspectives and feedback, others are oriented towards the dissemination of information and fostering understanding within the target audience, while some can be used for both purposes.

---

## Overview: Three Categories of Engagement Tools

The tools can be categorised into three main types according to the level of engagement and how the information flows between planners and stakeholders:

### 1. Knowledge Gathering
Tools and activities primarily designed to collect insights, perspectives and information from stakeholders. These approaches enable planners to access diverse knowledge and viewpoints that enhance the quality and relevance of energy scenarios.

**Tools**: Workshops, Surveys/Public Consultations, Interviews

### 2. Co-creation
Tools and activities that enable stakeholders to actively participate in shaping the planning process and its outcomes. These approaches establish collaborative environments where stakeholders work alongside planners to develop scenarios, explore trade-offs and build consensus.

**Tools**: Inter-institutional committees, Working groups, Networks/Hubs

### 3. Knowledge Dissemination
Tools and activities that focus on communicating energy planning concepts, scenarios and implications to various audiences. These approaches transform complex technical information into accessible formats tailored to different stakeholder needs.

**Tools**: Public presentations, Reports, Visualisation tools, Games/Simulations

## Tool Selection Decision Framework

With numerous participatory tools available for energy planning, selecting the right approaches can be challenging. This framework provides a flexible method to choose the most appropriate tools.

### Step 1: Define Your Planning Objective and Phase

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Framing** | Co-define policy questions and targets |
| **Development** | Create narratives, gather data, develop scenarios |
| **Validation** | Present results and gather feedback for iteration |
| **Communication** | Share final results with stakeholders |

### Step 2: Identify Priority Stakeholders
For each planning phase, identify which stakeholder groups are most critical.

### Step 3: Assess Available Resources
Evaluate the resources you can commit to participatory tools and activities.

### Step 4: Select Appropriate Tools

| If Your Objective Is... | Consider... |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Build consensus on policy priorities | Multi-stakeholder workshops, steering committees |
| Gather specialised technical input | Expert interviews, technical working groups, modelling networks/hubs |
| Balance competing stakeholder interests | Interdisciplinary committees, workshops |
| Communicate complex scenario results | Visualisation tools, targeted briefings and reports, presentations |
| Understand public acceptance concerns | Surveys, public hearings, focus groups |
| Build long-term engagement | Networks/hubs; steering committees; working groups; workshops |

### Step 5: Adapt to Limitations and Constraints
Explore good practices and prerequisites identified in each tool's subsection.

### Step 6: Evaluate the Benefits
Develop and compare indicators to help measure the success of the choice to the planning process.
