# Chapter 3: Stakeholders in the National Scenario Development Process

This chapter outlines the different stakeholder groups identified throughout this project with whom it is crucial for national energy planning teams to engage during the scenario development process.

For each stakeholder group, this chapter discusses:
- The objectives of engaging these stakeholders
- The challenges
- Good practices in overcoming these challenges
- The benefits for the stakeholders themselves for engaging in national energy planning

> **Note**: The following stakeholder list represents the groups present and discussed broadly during the preparatory activities to this report. However, each planning activity should examine their context to identify whether additional or other relevant stakeholders or categorisation would be utilised.

> **Fair and comprehensive stakeholder mapping** is critical for successful engagement but requires its own methodology beyond the scope of this toolkit. Key considerations include:
> - Using systematic approaches rather than ad-hoc methods
> - Employing multiple identification techniques to reduce bias
> - Ensuring representation of vulnerable groups
> - Validating through feedback channels
> - Potentially involving third parties for enhanced credibility
