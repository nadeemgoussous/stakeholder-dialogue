# Chapter 1: Introduction

The transition to a more sustainable and cleaner energy future requires strategic energy planning and informed decision making. Energy scenarios are a critical aspect of this planning process, enabling governments to:
- Prepare for future socio-technical changes and lifestyles
- Identify risks and opportunities
- Shape effective policies

Scenarios can also be used as tools to engage with a wide range of stakeholders, from industry experts to the general public, and can become a tool for enhancing the legitimacy of and buy-in to the planning process.

## Background: The LTES Network

Since 2018 IRENA has operated the Long-Term Energy Scenarios (LTES) Network, where government planning institutions across the world have shared their experiences and practices in developing and using long-term energy scenarios for clean energy policy making and its associated challenges.

Within the LTES Network, members and partners have continuously highlighted **participatory processes in scenario development** as a priority topic for accelerating the clean energy transition.

## The Expanding Stakeholder Landscape

The accelerated uptake of renewable energy and energy system innovation has brought many new players into the energy landscape. The range of stakeholders who are involved and affected has increased to include:
- Energy prosumers (individuals or entities that both produce and consume energy)
- Energy co-operatives
- Local communities
- Indigenous and minority groups
- Businesses

This brings the importance of energy to the foreground of people's day-to-day lives, increasing their interest in participating in energy-related planning and decision making.

While interest in participatory energy planning continues to grow, **meaningful participation remains a challenge that requires deliberate effort**.

Energy planning experts have stressed the importance of including the values and insights of different stakeholders in their short- and long-term planning processes to represent the true complexity of an energy system in transition.

## Prevalence of Participatory Processes

IRENA analysis of energy and climate planning alignment has shown that a majority of both energy plans and long-term low emission development strategies (LT-LEDS) have involved participatory processes as part of their development.

These activities have ranged from:
- Simple surveys and interviews
- Years-long agendas involving workshops, committees and other interactive activities aimed at a wide range of stakeholders

The findings of this toolkit stem from a collaborative process, using experience-sharing activities and practitioner insights from around the world.

## 1.1 Objective of the Publication

This toolkit is aimed at scenario practitioners and energy planners in government planning institutions, and establishes the importance of participatory processes in energy planning, especially in the context of the energy transition.

It offers a comprehensive and practical resource for incorporating participatory processes by showcasing country, regional and global experiences.

Building on previously published resources on participatory policy making, community engagement and communication in various fields of planning and project implementation, this publication is intended for **national-level energy planners**, especially at a time when there is growing emphasis on involving stakeholders in shaping future pathways for a just transition.

### Toolkit Overview

At its core, the toolkit highlights:
1. The importance of participatory energy planning
2. Different lessons, tools and stakeholders that can be engaged at different stages
3. Practical recommendations for maximising results of participatory approaches

## 1.2 How the Toolkit Was Developed

This toolkit has been developed on the basis of collective experiences and participatory processes observed within the LTES Network since 2018.

### Development Activities

The activities that provided the content of this report emphasised engagement and collaboration:

- **Thematic workshops, webinars and events** facilitated engagement with crucial stakeholders
- Over **50 speakers and 300 participants** engaged in meaningful discussions on participatory processes and public engagement in energy planning
- A **scientific advisory committee** influenced the report's structure and content
- **Interactive sessions, literature reviews and expert interviews** ensured comprehensive understanding

This methodology, centred on active participation and expert guidance, has been instrumental in shaping a toolkit that reflects current good practices and innovative strategies in facilitating inclusive participatory processes in LTES.

## 1.3 How to Use This Toolkit

This toolkit aims to both showcase the relevance of participatory energy planning for a clean and just transition, and provide resources for national government energy planners to refer to as they design participatory activities.

The toolkit was developed in a **modular fashion** so that different chapters can be used individually for the different elements of a participatory energy planning strategy.

### Using the Toolkit: A Three-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Identify Approaches That Match Your Planning Context
- Review the case studies in [Chapter 5](./chapter-5-case-studies.md) to find examples from countries with similar challenges or objectives
- Use the stakeholder mapping guidance in [Chapter 3](./chapter-3-stakeholders.md) to identify which stakeholder groups are most critical for your planning process and stage
- Consider your objectives, available resources and institutional capacity when selecting tools from [Chapter 4](./chapter-4-engagement-tools.md)

#### Step 2: Design Your Participation Strategy
- Begin with the framework in [Chapter 2](./chapter-2-importance-participatory-processes.md) to understand which benefits of stakeholder participation align with your planning objectives
- Use the stakeholder analysis in [Chapter 3](./chapter-3-stakeholders.md) to develop targeted engagement approaches
- Select appropriate tools from [Chapter 4](./chapter-4-engagement-tools.md) based on your planning stage and specific needs

#### Step 3: Implement Effectively
- Draw on the practical lessons from case studies in [Chapter 5](./chapter-5-case-studies.md) to anticipate challenges
- Adapt the approaches to your institutional context and available resources
- Utilise the additional resources in [Chapter 7](./chapter-7-additional-material.md) for detailed implementation guidance
